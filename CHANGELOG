Tree 
	If attempting to add list implementations in a tree, a crash occurs on deallocation
	data @ uniquegraphvector is forced to use my comparator
List
	(LATER) unique(valueComparator)
	(LATER) sort has complexity 2N+logN (because changing tail requires full iteration)
Map
	(LATER) convert MapEntry comparators into key comparators (like @ STL)
	LinkedHashMap
		(LATER) unique(valueComparator)
Graph
	add support for weighted graphs
	(LATER) test for cycles @ (non-unique) Graph
	data @ uniquegraphvector is forced to use my comparator
Document all code
test what happens whe we try to use another data type than long/char* @ all data structures
CONVERT COMPARATORS TO STRUCT?
