(BUG): 
	If attempting to add list implementations in a tree, a crash occurs on deallocation

ALL:
	add comparator function pointer arguments to all methods that require a comparator (instead of predefining a comparator):
		list
			- containsValue
			- removeValue
		map
			a hasher and keyComparator are globally required
			value comparator is not required
				- containsValue
				- removeValue
		set
			a hasher and keyComparator are globally required
linkedhashmap
	(LATER) unique(valueComparator)
map
	(LATER) unify sort test methods (since now iterators work the same)
list
	+ (LATER) unique(valueComparator)
FIX: sort has complexity 2N+logN (because changing tail requires full iteration)
ISSUE: @TreeNode  
+ add UniqueValueTreeNode
+ interators (VERY DIFFICULT)
