Tree 
	If attempting to add list implementations in a tree, a crash occurs on deallocation
List
	(LATER) unique(valueComparator)
Map
	(LATER) convert MapEntry comparators into key comparators (like @ STL)
	LinkedHashMap
		(LATER) unique(valueComparator)
(LATER) sort has complexity 2N+logN (because changing tail requires full iteration)
