(BUG): 
	If attempting to add list implementations in a tree, a crash occurs on deallocation

ALL:
	(LATER) convert MapEntry comparators into key comparators (like @ STL)
linkedhashmap
	(LATER) unique(valueComparator)
map
	(LATER) unify sort test methods (since now iterators work the same)
list
	+ (LATER) unique(valueComparator)
FIX: sort has complexity 2N+logN (because changing tail requires full iteration)
ISSUE: @TreeNode  
+ add UniqueValueTreeNode
