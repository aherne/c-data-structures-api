(LATER) unit tests & benchmarks must be split into .h and .cpp
ALL:
	VERY IMPORTANT: invalidate internal iterators on any add/remove
linkedhashmap
	+ (LATER) unique(valueComparator)
map
	* (LATER) add keyComparator and valueComparator template args to all
	* logic of removeIndex/Value should be as simple as @ dlllist
	(LATER) unify sort test methods (since now iterators work the same)
set
	* (LATER) add valueComparator template arg to all
list
	+ create separate test cases for addToTop
		PHP: operator[] will always add to bottom!
	+ (LATER) unique(valueComparator)
	+ (LATER) remove @ iterator
FIX: sort has complexity 2N+logN (because changing tail requires full iteration)
