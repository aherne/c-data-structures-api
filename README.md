# c-data-structures-api

Building another STL instead of using the fast super-stable time-tested library that is already used by virtually all C++ programmers seems like a textbook example of "reinventing the wheel", which happens to be a most damning stigma in today's world of programming. CDS is my own implementation of data structures and algorithms in C++ built on a harmonical structure different from STL in being much lighter weight, structured on polymorphism (because if naturally fits the concepts of data structures), larger in scope (supporting trees and graphs also) and with equal or greater performance. The API itself (let's call it CDS from now on) is nothing more than a collection of decoupled independent components and their dependencies. Each component corresponds to a data structure designed polymorphically by an interface-implementation principle.
