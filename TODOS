List
	(LATER) unique(valueComparator)
	(LATER) sort has complexity 2N+logN (because changing tail requires full iteration)
Map
	LinkedHashMap: (LATER) unique(valueComparator)
Document all code

USE ArrayList instead of std:vector for tree

DFS:
	isCyclic
	isConnected
BFS:
	getShortestPath

Implement copy constructors for all structures aside of ArrayList
Implement const iterators for all structures
implement const correctness for all methods and classes. DO NOT send non-pointers by copy
