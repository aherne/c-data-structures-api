List
	(LATER) unique(valueComparator)
	(LATER) sort has complexity 2N+logN (because changing tail requires full iteration)
Map
	LinkedHashMap: (LATER) unique(valueComparator)
Document all code

USE ArrayList instead of std:vector for tree

DFS:
	isCyclic
	isPath
BFS:
	getShortestPath
	
Support for undirected graphs

make removeValue throw exception when no

Implement copy constructors for all structures aside of ArrayList
Implement const iterators for all structures
implement const correctness for all methods and classes. avoid at all costs sending non-pointers by copy
