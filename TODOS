List
	(LATER) unique(valueComparator)
	(LATER) sort has complexity 2N+logN (because changing tail requires full iteration)
Map
	LinkedHashMap
		(LATER) unique(valueComparator)
Graph
	(LATER) test for cycles @ (non-unique) Graph
Document all code
test what happens whe we try to use another data type than long/char* @ all data structures
+ bounded containers

USE ArrayList instead of std:vector for tree and graph
USE template<> for comparators; value comparison in lists should use template arguments
